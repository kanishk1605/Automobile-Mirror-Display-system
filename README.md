# Automobile-Mirror-Display-system

Implement Automobile Display Mirror System on an FPGA board that takes four 8-bit data from four different sensors and display the data at the output using the selector switches of the Multiplexer. Assume that the 8-bit output then goes to display that knows how to convert the binary number to decimal.
