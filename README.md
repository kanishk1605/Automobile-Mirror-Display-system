# Automobile-Mirror-Display-system

Implement an Automobile Display Mirror System on an FPGA board that takes four 8-bit data from four different sensors and displays the data at the output using the selector switches of the Multiplexer. Assume that the 8-bit output then goes to a display that knows how to convert the binary number to decimal.
Some cars come with a display above the car window mirror as shown below:
