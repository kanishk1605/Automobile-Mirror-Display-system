# Automobile-Mirror-Display-system

Implement an Automobile Display Mirror System on an FPGA board that takes four 8-bit data from four different sensors and displays the data at the output using the selector switches of the Multiplexer. Assume that the 8-bit output then goes to a display that converts the binary number to decimal.

Some cars come with a display above the car window mirror as shown below:

A driver can press a button named mode to select among displaying the average miles-per-gallon of the car and approximate miles remaining until the car runs out of gas.

Assume the car's central computer sends the data to display in four 8-bit binary numbers, T(temperature), A
